## Synopsis

## Data Processing

The data is read and we use the str() to take a peek at the data:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
data<-read.csv("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2")
str(data)
```

## Analysis

We order the dataset based on the fatalities and injuries.

```{r}
ordered_by_fatalities<-data[order(-data$FATALITIES),]
ordered_by_injuries<-data[order(-data$INJURIES),]
```

Let's take a look at the head of the ordered fatalities dataset:

```{r}
head(ordered_by_fatalities)
```

And the injuries dataset:

```{r}
head(ordered_by_injuries)
```
