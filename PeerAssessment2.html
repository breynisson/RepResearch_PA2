## 198704 An intense heat wave affected northern Illinois from Wednesday July 12 through Sunday July 16. The heat wave tied or broke several temperature records at Rockford and Chicago. But what set this heat wave apart from others was the extremely high humidities. Dew point temperatures peaked in the lower 80s late Wednesday the 12th and Thursday the 13th and were generally in the middle and upper 70s through the rest of the hot spell. The combined and cumulative effects of several days of high temperatures, high humidity, intense July sunshine (100% possible sunshine recorded at O&#39;Hare Airport in Chicago July 13) and light winds took their toll. 583 people died as a result of the heat in Chicago and surrounding areas. Official temperatures at Chicago&#39;s O&#39;Hare International Airport were 7/12; minimum 73 maximum 97 (tied record), 7/13 minimum 81 (record) maximum 104 (record), 7/14 minimum 83 (record), maximum 100 (tied record), 7/15 minimum 75, maximum 98, 7/16 minimum 74, maximum 93. The heat peaked on Thursday July 13. O&#39;Hare had a high of 104 and a low of 81 for an average of 93, 20 degrees above normal. (The all-time record high for Chicago is 105.) The heat index peaked at 119 at 1300 and 1700. At Midway Airport the temperature hit 106. (Midway is not the official Chicago reporting station so the 106 did not become Chicago&#39;s official highest temperature.) The heat index at Midway reached 125 at 1400 when the temperature was 103 and the dew point was 79. What was really remarkable was that Meigs Field which sits on a small peninsula over the cool waters of Lake Michigan off the Chicago lakefront reached 103 degrees with a heat index of 115. Rockford had high temperatures of 97, 98, 97 and 94 on the 12 through 15th, respectively. The minimum of 75 on the 14th was a record. The heat index peaked at 125 at 1800 pm on the 13th when the temperature was 98 with a dew point of 83! Commonwealth Edison, which provides much of northern Illinois and virtually all of the Chicago metropolitan area with power, had record demands for electricity on the 12th through the 14th. Power output was 18,234, 19,151 and 19,201 megawatts, respectively. Transformers blew in the southwest suburbs near Joliet causing rolling power outages on the 13th and 14th. The north side of Chicago also lost power as did the northwest suburb of Cary. Draw bridges over the Chicago River had to be hosed down so they would operate and close properly. Several roads buckled from the heat. As many as 500 fire hydrants were opened in Chicago causing loss of water pressure. The city of Chicago used a record 1.8 billion gallons of water on the 13th. The city&#39;s water system has a capacity to pump 2 billion gallons a day. \nThere were over 580 fatalities attributed to the heat. Most of them occurred in the city of Chicago. Most of the deaths occurred two to three days following the peak of the heat wave. Many were elderly people living alone in homes or apartments with no air conditioning. Some had nailed windows shut and were afraid to go out because of crime in their neighborhoods. Emergency officials found people in homes with room temperatures of 120 degrees or higher. Here is a break down of fatalities by county; Lake County, 1 (Ingleside), Grundy County, 1 (Morris), Kane County, 7 (all in Aurora), Winnebago County, 5 (all in Rockford), Will County, 1 (Joliet), Cook, 568. The information from Cook County was provided by the Cook County Medical Examiners Office. 64 of the deaths occurred in suburban Cook County. 504 occurred in Chicago. The dates of the deaths are not known in all cases. Many of the examinations occurred in the days following the heat wave, more occurred later as funeral home and hospital records were checked.

with a frontal boundary in the area produced numerous severe storms with a few supercells across southeast Kansas. One cyclic supercell associated with the system produced a very large and deadly EF-5 tornado that hit the city of Joplin and then spawned two separate tornadoes that moved across southwestern Missouri. A separate tornadic supercell produced an EF-3 tornado that moved into McDonald County from Northeastern Oklahoma. \n\nContinuing thunderstorms lasted into July 23 as another line of thunderstorms moved across the region. This line of storms produced reports of large hail, damaging winds and a weak EF-0 tornado in south central Missouri. As the storms moved over the Joplin area, two police officers were struck by lightning while aiding in the post tornado efforts. One of the two officers later died of injuries from the lightning strike.EVENT NARRATIVE: National Weather Service survey teams rated the tornado that tracked across the southwest through east central portion of Joplin, Missouri, as an EF5 tornado.  Maximum winds were estimated to have exceeded 200 miles per hour. The tornado had a maximum width of one mile and an overall path length of nearly 21.6 miles, nearly nine miles of which occurred in Jasper County.\n\nThe tornado killed 158 directly, three indirectly, and injured over 1150 people.  Sadly, on May 24 a police officer who was volunteering from another department, was struck by lightning while serving in the response efforts and later died.  Equally, a 56 year old man who had been included as a direct fatality was later determined to have died of a heart attack.  Over 10,200 people filed for disaster assistance following the tornado.\n\nThe EF-5 rating (greater than 200 mph wind speeds) was mainly arrived at by the total destruction of vehicles, including some vehicles tossed several blocks and semi trucks thrown a quarter of a mile. Parking stops weighing over 300 pounds and re-barred into asphalt were uprooted and tossed.  Other factors in the rating included damage to reinforced concrete structures, and that St. Johnb

Heavy freezing rain fell across the counties near the Ohio River and heavy sleet mixed in across the central counties. Ice accumulations averaged three-quarter to two inches. Thunderstorms with heavy freezing rain occurred over parts of southern Ohio the evening of the 8th. Trees, including numerous fruit trees, and power lines were downed and damaged in many southern Ohio communities. Supplies of salt, already low from previous storms, were used up by many communities hindering ice removal. Temperatures during and after the storm remained quite cold, in the teens and single digits, also slowing ice removal. Travel on foot and by vehicle was treacherous. The extended cold, the inability to remove all the ice, and school closings (some schools were closed through the 11th) produced a record number of injuries, mostly due to falls and sledding accidents. Most were broken bones. At least a half dozen traffic fatalities occurred and one death can be directly attributed to the weather. A Middletown (Butler) man, age 40, died of exposure. Some freezing drizzle lingered into the 9th.

One cyclic supercell associated with the system produced a very large and deadly EF-5 tornado that hit the city of Joplin and then spawned two separate tornadoes that moved across southwestern Missouri. A separate tornadic supercell produced an EF-3 tornado that moved into McDonald County from Northeastern Oklahoma. \n\nContinuing thunderstorms lasted into July 23 as another line of thunderstorms moved across the region. This line of storms produced reports of large hail, damaging winds and a weak EF-0 tornado in south central Missouri. As the storms moved over the Joplin area, two police officers were struck by lightning while aiding in the post tornado efforts. One of the two officers later died of injuries from the lightning strike.EVENT NARRATIVE: National Weather Service survey teams rated the tornado that tracked across the southwest through east central portion of Joplin, Missouri, as an EF5 tornado.  Maximum winds were estimated to have exceeded 200 miles per hour. The tornado had a maximum width of one mile and an overall path length of nearly 21.6 miles, nearly nine miles of which occurred in Jasper County.\n\nThe tornado killed 158 directly, three indirectly, and injured over 1150 people.  Sadly, on May 24 a police officer who was volunteering from another department, was struck by lightning while serving in the response efforts and later died.  Equally, a 56 year old man who had been included as a direct fatality was later determined to have died of a heart attack.  Over 10,200 people filed for disaster assistance following the tornado.\n\nThe EF-5 rating (greater than 200 mph wind speeds) was mainly arrived at by the total destruction of vehicles, including some vehicles tossed several blocks and semi trucks thrown a quarter of a mile. Parking stops weighing over 300 pounds and re-barred into asphalt were uprooted and tossed.  Other factors in the rating included damage to reinforced concrete structures, and that St. Johnb
## 344159 M6VE, M77VE\nThe Great October Flood\n\nIn advance of a very slow-moving upper level trough of low pressure over West Texas, a cold front drifted slowly southeastward into West Central Texas during the evening of Friday, October 16th.  Deep moisture was in place across South Central Texas as the two systems approached, being fed at the mid and upper levels by two nearly stationary hurricanes, Madeline near the tip of Baja Mexico, and Lester, anchored just off Acapulco, Mexico, and in the low levels by a strong flow from the Gulf of Mexico.  A very moisture-rich environment was in place across South Central Texas as the event developed.  Near 3 am CST, with the cold front still west of San Angelo, scattered showers and thunderstorms began to break out  over Bexar County beneath the mid and upper level moisture plume.  They quickly became widespread as a low level rain-cooled boundary formed along the south and east edge of the county.  It was upon this boundary that subsequent showers and thunderstorms continued to form.  By 6 am CST, rainfall of up to 4 inches had been reported in Western Bexar County, with amounts approaching 4 inches in Western Comal County.  By 8 am CST that morning, heavy rain continued over Bexar County, and had spread northward across Comal County into Hays, Travis and Williamson Counties.  Amounts at this time were approaching 8 inches in Bexar and Comal Counties and 4 inches in Hays and Travis Counties.  The heavy rain continued through the morning period.  \n\nShortly before noon on Saturday, heavy rain began to spread eastward into Guadalupe, Caldwell, Bastrop and Lee Counties.  Through the mid afternoon, moderate to heavy rain continued between San Antonio and Austin, with widespread heavy rain over Comal, Hays, Caldwell, Guadalupe and Gonzales Counties.  By 5 pm CST, the strongest low level flow had also shifted eastward, focusing the heaviest rainfall through the evening period over the area from LaGrange to Gonzales to Karnes City to Cuero and Hallettsville. \n\nBy midnight, heavy rain had exited the Cuero-Hallettsville area, and moderate rain had again broken out over Bexar and Comal Counties.  The activity spread westward through the early morning hours on Sunday to Hondo and Uvalde and northwestward into the Hill Country.  At the same time, moderate to heavy rain also redeveloped along and north of a line from San Antonio to Gonzales to LaGrange.  By late Sunday morning, the cold front moved through South Central Texas, and had slowed and stalled as it approached the Lower Texas Coast.  Spotty heavy rainfall continued in the wake of the front between San Antonio, Burnet and Bastrop as another weak upper level disturbance in the southwesterly flow aloft approached.  Heavy rain also developed along the front, just north of Laredo and along the coastal plains from Corpus Christi to Victoria.  Even though rainfall amounts in the San Antonio to New Braunfels to San Marcos to Austin corridor were generally below 2 inches on Sunday, soils remained saturated from the previous day&#39;s deluge and periods of flash flooding were reported through the mid morning.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, rain had diminished in the San Antonio to Austin corridor, while clouds, rain and frequent showers continued east of the area.  Thereafter, rainfall was generally along and east of a LaGrange-Gonzales-Karnes City line, where an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain fell on Sunday and 2 to 4 inches fell on Monday.  Only scattered light rain was reported on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 20th and 21st of October.\n\nAll rivers, creeks and streams along and east of a San Antonio to Austin line remained at or above flood stage from Saturday, October 17th through Sunday, October 18th, with a majority continuing to flood through Monday, October 19th.  On Tuesday, October 20th and Wednesday, October 21st,flooding was confined to rivers, streams and creeks along and east of a LaGrange-Gonzales-Karnes City line.  \n\nThis event broke rainfall records across South Central Texas, producing 18 floods of record in South Central Texas streams.  October became the wettest of any month in climate records for San Antonio since 1885.  October 17th became the wettest day and wettest 24-hour period in San Antonio climatic records, nearly doubling both previous records. Rivers across the area reached or exceeded record stage heights, resulting in widespread flooding in the flood plains of streams, creeks and rivers. Rainfall amounts on October 17 and 18th from northern Bexar County to southeast Kendall County, most of Comal County and southern Hays County ranged from 15 to 22 inches.  Damage and destruction to livestock and agriculture, roads and bridges and both public and property and buildings significantly exceeded that of previous flooding.  Thousands to tens of thousands of livestock were killed, as nearly 3000 homes were destroyed and another 8000 or so homes were damaged.  Nearly 1000 mobile homes were destroyed and another 3000 were damaged.\n\nTwenty-five people drowned as a direct result of the flooding in October in South Central Texas.  All nine deaths in Bexar County on Saturday, as well as the two on Sunday, were associated with driving vehicles into flooded waters.  Four of the six Caldwell County deaths, two of the three Guadalupe County deaths, and all of the four deaths in Comal, Travis and Uvalde County were associated with vehicles as well.  Two deaths in Caldwell County and one in Guadalupe County occurred as residents were swept by flood waters from their homes.  In addition, one man in Comal County suffered a heart attack and died waiting to be rescued and another died of a heart attack while being rescued.  A third man in Guadalupe County accidently touched a live wire while in his boat.  He was severely shocked and died from drowning as a result of the shock.\n
